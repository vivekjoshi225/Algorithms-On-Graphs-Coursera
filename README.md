# Algorithms on Graphs - Coursera

<strong>Notes:</strong> 
1. I have personally taken up this course and have received certiicate for it. It's just for my personal learning purpose.
2. Most of the solutions are in Java. I have kept the original files for other languages just for the sake of completness.
